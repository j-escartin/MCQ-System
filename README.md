A Project on OOP Principle, Data Structure and Algorithm

## Project Overview

Java programming has taken the limelight of the evolving technology. It became a sole player of most automation and artificial intelligence that humanities have reached. Due to its reliability, usability, cross-platform compatibility, and security features, Java has emerged as a top language for developing global Internet solutions (IBM, 2022).

The project is all about creating a MCQ System through java programming. The project will read a csv file as source of data about the questions and its choices. The project also enables to explore different aspects of java. See the following:
